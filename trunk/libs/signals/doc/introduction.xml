  <title>Introduction 介绍</title>

<para>The Boost.Signals library is an implementation of a managed
signals and slots system. Signals represent callbacks with multiple
targets, and are also called publishers or events in similar
systems. Signals are connected to some set of slots, which are
callback receivers (also called event targets or subscribers), which
are called when the signal is "emitted."<sbr/>
Boost.Signals 库实现了一个可控的信号插槽系统。信号代表了具有多个目标的回调，
在类似的系统中也称为发布者或事件。 信号与某组插槽相连接，插槽即回调的接收者
（也称为事件目标或订阅者），它们在信号“发出”时被调用。</para>

<para>Signals and slots are managed, in that signals and slots (or,
more properly, objects that occur as part of the slots) track all
connections and are capable of automatically disconnecting signal/slot
connections when either is destroyed. This enables the user to make
signal/slot connections without expending a great effort to manage the
lifetimes of those connections with regard to the lifetimes of all
objects involved.<sbr/>
信号和插槽是可控的，因为信号和插槽（或严格地说是作为插槽出现的对象）跟踪所有的连接，
并能够在信号或插槽销毁时自动断开信号/插槽的连接。这让使用者能够在建立信号/插槽连接的同时，
不必费力地根据相关对象的生命期去管理那些连接的生命期。</para>

<para>When signals are connected to multiple slots, there is a
question regarding the relationship between the return values of the
slots and the return value of the signals. Boost.Signals allows the
user to specify the manner in which multiple return values are
combined.<sbr/>
当信号连接多个插槽时，插槽的返回值和信号的返回值之间是什么关系呢？这是个问题。
Boost.Signals 允许用户合并多个返回值，并指定合并的方式。</para>
