  </li>

    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>16 May 2002 - draft #3 uploaded to boost
    
    <ul>

      <li>Ability to specify serialization of other templates in a
          non-intrusive way.
      </li>
      <li>Included and example which uses boost::shared_ptr.
      </li>
      <li>improved documentation
      </li>
      <li>More test cases
      </li>
      <li>More testing and documentation of obscure situtations
      </li>
      <li>Better code organization for transparency
      </li>
      <li>Wide character support implemented and tested with unicode.
    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>28 Jun 2002 - #4 library submission
    
    <ul>

      <li>minor corrections
      </li>
      <li>replaced erroneous shared_ptr example with std::auto_ptr example
      </li>
      <li>prevention of memory leaks when exceptions are invoked
    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>30 Aug 2002 - #5 library submission
    
    <ul>

      <li>minor corrections
      </li>
      <li>Additions to documentation to explicitly address issues of
          exception safety.
      </li>
      <li>More test cases/demos to illustrate handlling of the above issues.
      </li>
      <li>Additions to documentation to include rationale for not depending
          on type_id
      </li>
      <li>Implementation of serialization of boost::shared_ptr.
          This is included as a demo as it depends upon a minor alteration
          of boost::shared_count.
    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>08 Nov 2002   - #6 library submission
    
    <ul>

      <li>minor corrections
      </li>
      <li>corrected error which manifested itself when serializing
          polymorphic pointers to obects derived from multiple
          base classes
      </li>
      <li>minor adjustments to support plug-ins via virtual
          save/load/version functions
      </li>
      <li>test cases to support the above
    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>08 September 2003- version # 12 library submission

  </li>
  <li>November 2003 - draft #13 uploaded
    
    <ul>

      <li>corrections, enhancements, change in api for pointer overload
    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>28 December 2003
    
    <ul>

       <li>implementation of save/loadbinary

    </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>1 March 2004 - draft # 17 upload
    
    <ul>

       <li>portability to intel 8.0, and VC 6.0
       </li>
      <li>Alter archive implementation to permit derivation.  Make tests.
       </li>
      <li>Implement serialize/save/load binary for text and XML archives
       using <code>base64</code> character encoding.
       </li>
      <li>Added documentation and test for serialization of large binary objects.
       </li>

      <li>Added PIMPL example

      <li>certain special situations are now detected and addressed at
       compile time to generate all in-line code.  For example, for types
       serialized without class information, and without memory tracking,
       the serialization process can be reduced to a minimal amount of inline
       code.
